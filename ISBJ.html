<p style="font-size: 23px;">Dr. Vishwanath Karad, the founder member of Maharashtra Academy of 
Engineering and Educational Research's (MAEER) had a vision to build a world 
class institution in Maharashtra. After due perusal with the authorities, Dr. Karad 
managed to attract the attention of the authorities to the intense need of private 
players to venture out in the field of professional education for the benefit of the 
state, and the rest is history. The journey of MAEER - in 1983 began with the 
establishment of Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT), one of the first 
private engineering colleges in Maharashtra which still remains the flagship 
institute of the group.</p>
